# Github Flavored Markdown - Tasklist

A simple vscode extentension that extends the markdown preview to support the tasklist markup of Github flavored markdown.

```markdown

- [ ] Marks the entry as to be done and renders a un-checked checkbox.
- [x] Marks the entry as done and renders a checked checkbox.

```

Checkboxes are currently in a disabled state within the preview, and having them disabled would only makes sense if the state change was also reflected in the source markdown. (Future Idea?)
